Digital transformation reinvents companies, their vision and strategy, organizational structure, processes, capabilities, culture, and enables the development of new or enhanced products and services delivered to customers more efficiently. By formalizing their digital strategy, organizations attempt to plan for their digital transformations and accelerate their company growth. Understanding how successful a company is in its digital transformation starts with accurately measuring its digital maturity levels. However, existing approaches  to measuring  organizations' digital strategy have  inconsistent results, and also do not provide resources (data) for future research to improve. In order to measure the digital strategy maturity of companies and provide a benchmark, we leverage the state-of-the-art NLP models on unstructured data (earning call transcripts), and reach the state-of-the-art F1 levels (94\%) for this task. We release 3.691 earning call transcripts and also annotated data set labeled particularly for the digital strategy maturity by linguists.
